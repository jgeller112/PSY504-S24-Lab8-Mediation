## Data

For this lab, we will replicate the mediation results of Cho et al.'s (2023) study titled "Changes in Medial Prefrontal Cortex Mediate Effects of Heart Rate Variability Biofeedback on Positive Emotional Memory Biases." On page 7 of the article, the authors provide a path diagram (Fig. 2) of the mediation model they employed. The data for the mediation analysis can be found at https://osf.io/t5s4z/.

## Task

Your task is to reproduce the study by Cho et al. (2023) by following the steps below:

> Apply Baron & Kenny's causal steps approach to test their mediation model

> Test for mediation using the joint significance test

> Use the Lavaan package to run the mediation model and calculate the bootstrapped indirect effect

> Create a path model diagram (labeling things appropiately) using your preferred software

> Write-up a report using APA style and provide a discussion of the findings. Discuss if there is mediation according to the causual steps, joint significance, and bootrapped approaches. If there are any differences between your analysis and Cho et al. please describe them. 
Additionally, share your thoughts on how the authors shared their data
